#summary A guide to installing vs-android
#labels Phase-Deploy

=Installing vs-android=

  * Download the latest release of vs-android from [http://code.google.com/p/vs-android/downloads/list here].

  * Unzip it anywhere you want. The install process copies files out of it, so you can safely delete it when you're done.

  * Go into the `MsBuild` directory of what you just unzipped.

  * For Windows 2000 or XP, just double click on 'install.cmd'.

  * For Vista or Windows 7 you will need to right click 'install.cmd', and choose to 'Run as Administrator". Don't worry, you can view the install batch file in notepad if you wish. All it does is copy files to the correct place in your Visual Studio install.

  * That's it. The command box that pops up should show a number of files as successfully copied. It will prompt you to press any key, and then close itself.

  * Feel free to delete the files you unzipped earlier. They are no longer required. 

==Manual Install==

If you don't want to run the 'install.cmd' file, you can copy the files manually. Obviously skip these steps if you already installed it.

  * In the 'MSBuild' directory contained in the zip file is a directory named 'Android'.

  * Navigate to one of these directories, depending on whether you are running 32-bit or 64-bit windows:

`C:\Program Files\MSBuild\Microsoft.Cpp\v4.0\Platforms`

`C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft.Cpp\v4.0\Platforms`

  * In this directory will already be a 'Win32' subdirectory. Possibly an 'Itanium' and 'x64' directories too. You want that 'Android' directory to sit alongside them.

  * That's it. You can check inside the 'Win32' and 'Android' directories to ensure that they look similar. The Android one has a couple of extra xml files though.



=NDK Setup=

  * Download the NDK from here: [http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html]

  * Unzip it somewhere, and note the root directory.

  * You need to set an environment variable named *ANDROID_NDK_ROOT* which points to this directory. This can be done from the command line:
<pre>
`setx ANDROID_NDK_ROOT c:\android-ndk-r6`
</pre>



=SDK Setup=

  * Java is a prerequisite for the Android SDK. Install the JDK from here:
[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html]

  * You'll also need the Android SDK itself, download it from here:
[http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html]

  * Use the installer version. It's the easiest way. Be sure to run the 'SDK Manager' it installs afterwards, so it can download the latest packages.



=Ant Setup=

  * Download Ant from here:
[http://ant.apache.org/]

  * Unzip it somewhere, just like you did for the NDK.

  * Set an environment variable named *ANT_HOME* to point to where you unzipped it. For example:
<pre>
`setx ANT_HOME c:\apache-ant-1.8.2`
</pre>


=Spaces=

 * Starting with vs-android v0.9, all of the above SDK installations can be made to directories which contain spaces. Even the NDK!



=Finished=

  * At this point you can build NDK executables in Visual Studio! 

  * If you already had any Visual Studio sessions open, you will need to close and reopen them to make use of the new 'Android' platform.

  * Go ahead and download the Sample Projects: [HowTo_Samples Compiling a simple Android app with vs-android]. It's an easy way to get started.
