#summary Compiling a simple Android app with vs-android

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

==Installation==

  * Follow the [Installation] instructions to install vs-android. 

  * Close down any instances of Visual Studio you may have had open before or during installation. You need to start with fresh after you install.

==Samples==

  * Go here and download the sample projects:
[http://vs-android.googlecode.com/files/vs-android_samples.zip vs-android_samples.zip]

  * Unzip them so they live in a path that doesn't contain spaces. Unfortunately the .apk building step requires a path without spaces.
<pre>
c:\Projects\samples\        < GOOD! :)
c:\My Projects\samples\     < BAD :(
</pre>

  * Let's start with san-angeles. Go into that directory and open up the .sln file inside it.


==San Angeles==

  * San Angeles is a simple OpenGL ES 1.0 graphical demo

  * With the solution opened in Visual Studio, go into the 'Build' menu, and click 'Build Solution'.

  * Observe the build process. You'll likely have an error if the installation failed. The errors should be pretty verbose and describe measures of how to fix them.

  * The projects are setup to auto-deploy and run onto a connected device. You can start a virtual device through the 'SDK Manager' if you wish. San Angeles works fine on the virtual device.
