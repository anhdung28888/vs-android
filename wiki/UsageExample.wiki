#summary Compiling a simple Android app with vs-android
#labels Phase-Deploy

  * After you have installed vs-android, start up Visual Studio 2010.

  * Go to the 'File' menu, choose 'New -> Project...'

  * The location you place the project isn't important. I suggest using a path that doesn't have spaces, since I haven't tested paths which contain spaces.

  * Uncheck 'Create directory for solution'. This puts the sln file and the vcxproj in the same directory. It will still create one directory off the base path you give. So in my case below, it'll end up in "C:\projects\san-angeles"

  * Download [http://vs-android.googlecode.com/files/san-angeles.zip san-angeles.zip].

  * You'll want to unzip this so that the directory containing "AndroidManifest.xml" sits alongside the sln and vcxproj files that were just created. So that same directory would have the 'jni', 'res', and 'src' sub-directories too.

  * Go into the 'jni' directory and drag over the following files into your project as shown:

  * Be sure to leave out the win32 and linux files. Delete them from the Visual Studio project if you accidentally brought them in.
