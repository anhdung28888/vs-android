vs-android issue:

The full error:
<code>
1>      [apply] Could not create the Java virtual machine.
1>      [apply] Error occurred during initialization of VM
1>      [apply] Could not reserve enough space for object heap
</code>

You likely need to change the Java VM size.

As of vs-android v0.91 or later, it's possible to do this from within the Visual Studio IDE.

Go to the Project 'Properties', and look under 'Ant Build'->'General'. There's two settings:

  * Ant JVM Heap Initial Size (MB)
  * Ant JVM Heap Maximum Size (MB)

Those that have these problems have been setting both values to '512'. (no quotes)

Your mileage may vary, potentially you need some different values depending on your machine setup and the amount of Java code you're working with.

As mentioned in the HowTo_Samples section, your projects unfortunately need to live in a path that doesn't contain spaces:

<code>
 c:\Projects\samples\        < GOOD! :)
 c:\My Projects\samples\     < BAD :(
</code>

See this link for more info about the problem:

== adb.exe ==

vs-android issue:
  * [ http://code.google.com/p/vs-android/issues/detail?id=17 ]

adb.exe is prone to locking up.

This is a known issue, and something that affects its use both stand-alone and with vs-android. 

Interestingly it also affects the Mac version too:

If you notice the build output hang due to adb.exe, it'll be after the 'BUILD SUCCESSFUL' message from Ant:

<pre>
1>  BUILD SUCCESSFUL
1>  Total time: 3 seconds
1>  Deploying C:\Projects\vs-android\vs-android_samples\san-angeles\AndroidApk\bin\DemoActivity-debug.apk...
</pre>

If the build hangs here for a long time, here's some things to try:

  * At a command prompt, type:
<pre>adb usb</pre>
This will reboot the USB driver, which is a common problem. 

adb.exe should live in the \platform-tools directory of the Android SDK.

  * Kill 'adb.exe' in Task Manager.

Ctrl-Shift-Esc will bring up Task Manager. 

After it's dead, cancel the build within Visual Studio, if it's still running.

  * Try building again.
