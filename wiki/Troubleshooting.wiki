vs-android issue:

  * [ http://code.google.com/p/vs-android/issues/detail?id=19 ]

As mentioned in the HowTo_Samples section, your projects unfortunately need to live in a path that doesn't contain spaces:

<code>
 c:\Projects\samples\        < GOOD! :)
 c:\My Projects\samples\     < BAD :(
</code>

See this link for more info about the problem:

== adb.exe ==

vs-android issue:
  * [ http://code.google.com/p/vs-android/issues/detail?id=17 ]

adb.exe is prone to locking up.

This is a known issue, and something that affects its use both stand-alone and with vs-android. 

Interestingly it also affects the Mac version too:

If you notice the build output hang due to adb.exe, it'll be after the 'BUILD SUCCESSFUL' message from Ant:

<pre>
1>  BUILD SUCCESSFUL
1>  Total time: 3 seconds
1>  Deploying C:\Projects\vs-android\vs-android_samples\san-angeles\AndroidApk\bin\DemoActivity-debug.apk...
</pre>

If the build hangs here for a long time, here's some things to try:

  * At a command prompt, type:
<pre>adb usb</pre>
This will reboot the USB driver, which is a common problem. 

adb.exe should live in the \platform-tools directory of the Android SDK.

  * Kill 'adb.exe' in Task Manager.

Ctrl-Shift-Esc will bring up Task Manager. 

After it's dead, cancel the build within Visual Studio, if it's still running.

  * Try building again.
